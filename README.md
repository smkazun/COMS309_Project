# COMS309_Project

Fall 2019 Iowa State University COMS309 Software Development Practices

This was the first major group project that I had undertaken at the time. At the time, I had no knowledge of databases and minimal testing knowledge. This project shows my development of knowledge concerning frontend and backend systems and also serves as a reference that highlights how far I have come since then.
